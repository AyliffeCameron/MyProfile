            <h2>About Me.</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="maincontent">
            <p>36yo Male born and raised in Newcastle NSW. After dropping out of high school I started an apprenticeship as a Sheetmetal fabricator. Shortly after finishing my apprenticeship I upskilled and received my second qualification as and Aircraft Maintenance Engineer and have been fixing jets and snapping necks ever since (inside joke).</p>
            <p>I am an avid car enthusiast having modified some vehicles in sometimes stupid ways (like adding airbag suspension to a KIA). I love to have a go at everything and often find myself taking longer to do simple things purely because I want to know how stuff works.</p>

          <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>From about age 13, Circa 1997, just as I started high school, I found myself surfing the web on and old dial internet connection using a PC I’m pretty sure was built 10yrs prior. </p>
          <p>It was from here that I started show interest in computers (not knowing what “IT” was at the time) and much to my parent’s sadness, I tore apart the single computer they worked so hard to get in the pursuit of making it better.</p>
          <p>I sourced some components and “suped” it up, switched it back on and it was alive and working. At this point, I was hooked and have continued tinkering to this day. </p>
          <p>It has been some 23yrs since the moment I started mucking around with IT and am now in a position career wise that I want to continue to learn. Given my most recent dabble in the crypto space a feel like it is the right time to study IT as obviously I have and interest in it but also think I am ok at it. </p>
          <p>My family and working life commitments do not really led themselves to on campus study and having already completed some unrelated study the OUA, online study seemed right for me. </p>
          <p>After browsing the OUA catalogue and messing about on various universities websites, I liked the “vibe” I was getting from RMIT and hence here we are!</p>
          <p>I do not have a great deal of expectations coming into this course and the greater IT field of study. I guess I am just looking to undo some of the rookie errors I may have made during my time figuring stuff out for myself and hopefully reinforcing what I already know with the theory.</p>

          <p>The test results in the gallery to the left suggest that I prefer practical leaning experiences were coming up with ideas and proof concepts being strong points. I like to analyse ideas before acting on them and are confident in the results of my analysis.
          <p>Given that I am a thinker and introverted, I need to be mindful of not running away with an idea separate from the teams focus. I will likely develop several solutions to a problem and become fixated on the solution I think works best.
          <p>As part of team, I will need to ensure that I allow the team to discuss my ideas and accept the opinion of the greater team. The results show I am a “doer” and given a task I will complete it. As such, a team with strong leadership will likely prove best for me going forward.

          <h3>Project Idea</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>The Cryptocurrency Mining Equipment Reset System (CMERS) is designed as a low-cost DIY alternative to automate the hard reset of Crypto mining rigs in case of hardware error.
            <p>Partnered with commercial of the shelf (CoTS) hardware, this open-source software design is intuitive enough for casual miners yet provides professional level tools to manage your mining rig, no matter you experience level.
            <p>In addition to the automation, CMERS also provides web-based UI for remote functionality to rig mangers and system administrators alike. From here, they can send a hard reset command at the simple click of the button.</p>
          <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>2021 so far has seen a rise in value of the most popular cryptocurrency and with it so too has the profitability of several crypto algorithms <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-profitability-of-ethereum-cryptocurrency-mining-has-halved-in-a-week/.html">(PCGAMERS)</a>.
            <p>While arguably the words most popular crypto, Bitcoin is still mined by large organisations with specific hardware, other cryptos such as Ethereum are again attractive to GPU miners. Serious gamers and DIY farmers are once again dragging out their old hardware chasing that elusive return on investment (ROI).
            <p>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are an essential piece of computer hardware for any serious gamer or graphic designer. However, GPUs are also especially handy for solving the complex mathematical problems that makes some cryptocurrencies secure.
            <p>Using multiple GPUs for mining purposes tends to result in unstable or unresponsive hardware and often results in a hard reset. While the casual miners often have a day job and a rig parked in the corner of a room, there is likely a delay in accessing it physically to hit the reset button which results in lost profit while the rig is down.</p>
          <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>CMERS uses a standalone computing hardware to act as a remote hard reset switch.
            <p>The reset switch for Personal Computer (PC) motherboards is generally connected to two pins on the motherboard with one being a ground pin. When the reset button is depressed on the PC case, the circuit is closed and such grounds out the second pin triggering the hard reset.
            <p>With a ground and a general purpose input/output pin of the SoC computer connected to a NPN Transistor we can trigger the Transistor to switch closed thus simulating a reset button press. The wiring schematic would be as shown below in Figure 1. The GPIO ground pin would connect to the  collector terminal of the transistor and GPIO signal pin to the transistor base terminal.
            <p>The Emitter pin on the transistor would be connected to the sign pin on the mother board or alternatively splice into PC case reset button such that it may work in tandem with the PC cases reset button.
            <p>The Raspberry Pi will run a lite version of Ubuntu server as the base OS.  The Apache webserver package is required to deliver the webUI. The web UI is to be coded in HTML to present the user with a button which will run the required script triggering the reset of the connected device.
            <p>Several python scripts will be required to be written to perform the control of the 3 volt GPIO pin and monitor the mining operation. These scripts will be run in a matter of two ways.
            <p>Firstly, once the user accesses the webUI, a single button with the text “RESET RIG” will be displayed. When pressed, this should run the python script setting the GPIO pin to high which will allow the transistor to complete the ground circuit, triggering the reset.
            <p>In addition to the above, a second script should be automatically run after system boot. The script will be run by a cron job for approximately 5 minutes after mining rig boot however the user should set this to a time after they can verify the rig is mining. This script’s purpose is to monitor mining operations by pinging the mining rig for activity. If the reply is “unreachable” the rig will be considered offline or frozen and trigger the above reset script otherwise snooze for another 5 minutes and then run again.</p>
          <h4>Future Expansion</h4>
            <p>As the demand in GPU use increases due to mining operations the computer will in turn draw more current. This may be exploited by the use power monitoring device such as the emonPi Shield KIT by <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.openenergymonitor.com">open energy monitor</a> to monitor power load data for changes. This data could be used to determine a “normal” operation power load. The auto reset script could than monitor this and when the power draw is below a set threshold, the reset script is triggered.</p>
          <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
            <p>CMERS uses a small System on a Chip (SoC) computer called a Raspberry Pi with General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. The Raspberry Pi is connected to the mining rigs mainboard reset pins which are used to trigger a hard reset of the system. For remote access to CMERS, the SoC computer must be network connected.
            <p>A headless version of Linux running a webserver such as APACHE and some simple scripts written in Python takes care of the software requirements.
            <p>A Single GPIO jumper wire is all that is required to connect CMERS to the mining rig.</p>
          <h4>Skills Required</h4>
            <div id="ul2">
              <ul>
                <li>The Raspberry Pi Soc computer used in this project can be found at most hobbyist electronic stores and online for under $60 AUD and already WiFi enabled.
                <li>Ubuntu maintains a repository of Linux images for the Raspberry Pi and for CMERS Ubuntu Server is the image of choice for the base OS.
                <li>Apache HTTP Sever will need to be installed and the associated HTML code for the webGUI
                <li>Background commands executed from the web GUI to be written in Python.
                <li>NPN Transistor
                <li>Breadboard
                <li>At least 4 Jumper wires are required to attach the raspberry Pi to the mining rig however 6 are recommended for setting up the NPN Transistor with the assistance of a Breadboard. These items can be found at most hobby stores.
                <li>A Raspberry Pi Case to protect the RPi and keep things tidy. Available from Amazon or Ebay
              </ul>
            </div>
          <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>If this project is successful, the result should be a flexible, DIY device that many cryptocurrency mining hobbyists can make in their living room with items they either have lying around unused or can be purchased for a relatively small sum.
            <p>Users of CMERS should be able to have it up and running in no time and be able to remotely reset their mining rigs from anywhere as simply as playing a video on a webpage.
            <p>At the time of writing, a small gaming computer can mine as much as $1 every 3hrs and with an average working day of 9 hrs, a miner may potentially loose up to $3 if their rig went down while at work and was unable to reset it.
